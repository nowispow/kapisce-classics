# Characters: Pride and Prejudice

## Main Characters

*   **Elizabeth (Lizzy) Bennet**: The novel's intelligent and spirited protagonist. Possessing a "quickness of observation" and a sharp wit, she is the second eldest Bennet sister. Her journey is defined by her overcoming her initial "prejudice" against Mr. Darcy. She values genuine character and intellectual substance over social rank. Her growth culminates in her realizing the depth of Darcy's integrity after his intervention in the Wickham-Lydia scandal.
*   **Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy**: A wealthy gentleman, master of Pemberley, and the epitome of "pride" initially. He is socially reserved and hyper-critical, but his love for Elizabeth forces him to confront his elitism. His transformation from a man who dismisses Elizabeth as "tolerable" to one who would do anything for her family (saving Lydia's reputation) is the central arc of the novel.
*   **Mr. Bennet**: The patriarch of the Bennet family, characterized by "sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice." While intellectually sharp, his detachment and failure to provide firm guidance for his younger daughters contribute to the family's social crises. He shares a deep intellectual bond with Elizabeth.
*   **Mrs. Bennet**: A woman of "mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper." Her obsessive goal is to get her five daughters married. Her social ineptitude and lack of decorum often cause "mortification" to her elder daughters and jeopardize their social prospects.
*   **Jane Bennet**: The eldest Bennet sister, renowned for her serene beauty and "unaffected" manners. Her "candid" nature leads her to see only the good in everyone, including those who do not deserve it. Her romance with Mr. Bingley provides the novel's secondary plot of social and emotional reconciliation.
*   **Mr. Charles Bingley**: A wealthy, "unaffected," and "gentlemanlike" man. His "happy manners" and "ductility of temper" make him easily liked but also easily influenced by Darcy and his sisters. His genuine affection for Jane eventually triumphs over social pressure.
*   **Mr. George Wickham**: A charming militia officer with a shared history with Mr. Darcy. His "very pleasing address" masks a deceitful and mercenary nature. He serves as the primary antagonist to Elizabeth's judgment, as she initially believes his lies about Darcy, only to be shocked by his eventual elopement with Lydia.
*   **Mr. William Collins**: Mr. Bennet's cousin and the heir to Longbourn. A clergyman under the patronage of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, he is a man of "mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility." His proposal to Elizabeth is a masterpiece of absurdity and social climbing.

## Supporting Characters

*   **Charlotte Lucas**: Elizabeth’s pragmatic friend who marries Mr. Collins for "security" rather than love, illustrating the harsh economic realities for women of her status.
*   **Lady Catherine de Bourgh**: Darcy’s aunt and Mr. Collins's patroness. She represents the peak of aristocratic arrogance and "dictatorial" manners, attempting to prevent Darcy's marriage to Elizabeth to preserve her daughter's prospects.
*   **Lydia Bennet**: The youngest sister, unrestrained and reckless. Her elopement with Wickham threatens the entire family's reputation, serving as the catalyst for Darcy’s ultimate act of devotion to Elizabeth.
*   **Catherine (Kitty) Bennet**: The fourth sister, who improves significantly once removed from Lydia's influence.
*   **Mary Bennet**: The middle sister, who remains "pedantic" and socially awkward, preferring moralizing over meaningful interaction.
*   **Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner**: Elizabeth's aunt and uncle from London. They represent the "respectable" side of trade and serve as the voice of reason and social grace, facilitating the reconciliation at Pemberley.
*   **Georgiana Darcy**: Darcy's younger sister, shy and talented, whose near-scandal with Wickham provides critical context for Darcy's character and his protectiveness.
*   **Miss Caroline Bingley**: Bingley's "proud and conceited" sister who unsuccessfully attempts to secure Darcy's attention while sabotaging Elizabeth.
*   **Colonel Fitzwilliam**: Darcy's cousin, a "gentlemanlike" man who inadvertently provides Elizabeth with the information that Darcy separated Bingley and Jane.
