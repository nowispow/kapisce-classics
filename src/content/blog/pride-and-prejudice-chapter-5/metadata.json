    "The chapter introduces the Lucas family, providing a social foil to the Bennets: Sir William's 'courteous' obsession with his own knighthood vs. the Bennets' more chaotic domestic life.",
    "Charlotte Lucas is established as Elizabeth's intellectual peer and intimate friend, though her pragmatic views on social rank already hint at her future choices.",
    "The 'right' to be proud is debated, with Charlotte suggesting that wealth and status provide a legitimate excuse for Darcy's behavior, a viewpoint rooted in the rigid class structure of the time.",
    "Elizabeth's prejudice is explicitly linked to her own ego; she admits she could forgive Darcy's pride if it hadn't insulted her own sense of self-worth.",
    "The 'overhearing' of Bingley's praise for Jane serves to cement Jane's status as the community's primary beauty, further fueling Mrs. Bennet's marital ambitions.",
    "Mrs. Bennet's illogical social reasoning is showcased as she blames Darcy's silence on Mrs. Long's lack of a private carriage, projecting her own class anxieties.",
    "Mary Bennet's character is further developed as she offers a pedantic, textbook definition of pride versus vanity, showcasing her lack of practical social experience.",
    "The inclusion of the younger Lucas boy's materialistic fantasies about foxhounds and wine provides a humorous, unrefined look at the underlying power of Darcy's wealth."
