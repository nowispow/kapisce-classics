Wickham’s immediate shift toward Miss King after her grandfather's death leaves her with ten thousand pounds illustrates the brutal economic reality that even a 'charming' officer could not afford to marry for love alone. It also touches on the 'Grosvenor Street' social circle, representing the high-society barrier that Jane must attempt to penetrate in London.\",\n  \"summary\": \"Mrs. Gardiner kindly warns Elizabeth against an imprudent match with the penniless Wickham. Elizabeth promised to be 'wisest' but notes the difficulty of resisting temptation. Charlotte Lucas marries Mr. Collins and departs for Kent, leaving Elizabeth to mourn their lost intimacy. Meanwhile, Jane’s letters from London reveal that Caroline Bingley has been intentionally avoiding her and treating her with 'slight, formal' coldness. The chapter concludes with Wickham transferring his attentions to the newly wealthy Miss King, which Elizabeth views with pragmatic indifference, realizing she was never truly in love with him.\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"classic-literature\",\n    \"pragmatism\",\n    \"social-deception\",\n    \"economic-reality\",\n    \"heartbreak\",\n    \"advice\",\n    \"mercenary-marriage\"\n  ],\n  \"analysis\": {\n    \"key_argument_1\": \"The Gardiner Intervention: Mrs. Gardiner acts as the rational maternal figure that Elizabeth lacks. Her warning is not based on moral judgment but on the practical 'want of fortune,' highlighting the conflict between romantic inclination and social survival.\",\n    \"key_argument_2\": \"Elizabeth's Moral Elasticity: Elizabeth’s defense of Wickham’s pursuit of Miss King ('a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums') contrasts sharply with her earlier condemnation of Charlotte’s marriage. This reveals her personal bias; she is willing to forgive mercenary motives in those she finds charming.\",\n    \"key_argument_3\": \"The Death of the 'Angel' Narrative: Jane’s letter confessing she was 'entirely deceived' in Caroline Bingley marks a pivotal loss of innocence. Even Jane’s relentless optimism cannot withstand the 'strong appearance of duplicity' in Caroline’s behavior, signaling a shift in her moral education.\",\n    \"key_argument_4\": \"The Function of Disappointment: Mr. Bennet’s mockery of Jane being 'crossed in love' and his advice to Elizabeth to let Wickham 'jilt' her illustrates his view of suffering as a source of social 'distinction.' He fails to recognize the genuine emotional damage occurring within his family.\",\n    \"key_argument_5\": \"The Definition of Love through Hate: Elizabeth’s realization that she was never in love because she does not 'detest his very name' is a fascinating psychological insight. She equates the depth of love with the depth of the subsequent resentment, framing her own character as more intellectual than emotional.\",\n    \"key_argument_6\": \"Charlotte's Silent Victory: Charlotte’s letters from Hunsford, though 'rationally softened,' show her focusing exclusively on physical comforts and Lady Catherine’s 'friendly' behavior. She has successfully compartmentalized her irksome husband to achieve a life of material ease.\",\n    \"key_argument_7\": \"Caroline Bingley’s Strategic Coldness: Caroline’s 'slight, formal apology' and her refusal to invite Jane further into her circle confirm that her earlier friendship was purely a tool for managing her brother’s proximity to the Bennets. Once in London, the mask is no longer necessary.\",\n    \"key_argument_8\": \"The Power of Ten Thousand Pounds: Miss King’s grandfather’s death serves as a deus ex machina that tests Wickham's loyalty. His immediate defection proves that his 'happy manners' are a facade for a survivalist instinct as sharp as Charlotte Lucas's.\"\n  },\n  \"memorable_quotes\": [\n    {\n      \"quote\": \"Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Mrs. Gardiner’s blunt summary of the Regency social contract, where poverty is a barrier that even 'interest' and 'agreeability' cannot overcome.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"quote\": \"I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Elizabeth’s attempt to discipline her own emotions, showing her awareness of the 'danger' Wickham poses to her peace of mind.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"quote\": \"Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Highlights the permanent damage Charlotte’s marriage did to the friendship, as Elizabeth can no longer respect the 'worldly advantage' Charlotte chose.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"quote\": \"I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The moment Jane finally admits the truth of Caroline’s character, a significant and painful step in her maturation.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"quote\": \"If he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Jane's quiet, logical realization that Bingley's absence in a city as small as their social circle in London is a definitive sign of his indifference (or successful interference).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"quote\": \"Handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Elizabeth’s pragmatic and somewhat cynical justification for Wickham’s defection, using wit to soothe her own slighted vanity.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"quote\": \"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Elizabeth’s characteristic intellectualization of her feelings, using logic to prove to herself that she is safe from heartbreak.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"image_prompts\": [\n    {\n      \"topic\": \"The Aunt’s Warning\",\n      \"placement\": \"Chapter Header\",\n      \"prompt_text\": \"Highly detailed Renaissance-style painting in the style of Titian.
